# Bydrive

(Combat-) Racing game for s&box using the new scene system.
Partially spiritual successor to [Lego Drome Racers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drome_Racers)

Plans are to add a non-racing component in the future.

# Soundtrack

Right now the game is just reusing tracks from other media as placeholders.
These will be replaced later on in development.

What am i using as placeholders? Pretty much just tracks from other games that I like.

Tracklist:

- Main Menu Theme = [Lego Drome Racers - Main Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHCUS5ALVlo)
